# Flappy Zicc
This is a flappy bird clone with bad/funny graphics and bad code. **Please do not learn from my code.**

If you are trying to get it to run on your computer, but the texture is not loading, change line 65 `player.zicc = LoadTexture("resources/zicc.png");` so that the string is the file path you would find in windows explorer. Be sure to use / instead of \
c
